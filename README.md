# Connect 4 [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This application is a clone of the classic game Connect 4.  It supports both local and online multiplayer.  Online multiplayer also features real time chat.  This application was created using the MERN stack with TypeScript and GraphQl.  It was developed and tested by two developers over the course of two weeks.  That being said feel free to open issues and suggest changes.  A feature we are planning for future development is real time voice chat.
